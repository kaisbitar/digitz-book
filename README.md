<b>Problem statement: </b>
<p>Lack of automated tools to identify the numerical patterns that exist in the Quran and there are no search engines that provide the needed data for researchers to learn those patterns. The only current solution for researchers is manual counting or via excel sheets which lacks accuracy, consistency and is time-consuming.  </p>

<b>Solution: </b>
<p>Developed an automated platform that maps out all numerical patterns in Quran and allows visualising data through various charts views and tabular format.</p>
